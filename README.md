The Student Management System is a desktop interface developed using Java with Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI) and MySQL for managing the data.
The system enables efficient handling of student 
data by allowing users to perform the following operations:

(*) Add new student records: Users can input and store student details in the local MySQL database.

(*) Edit student information: The GUI allows users to update existing student data easily.

(*) Delete student records: Unwanted or outdated student data can be removed from the database.

(*) Save data: All changes are saved in the MySQL database for persistent storage.

(*) Swing components are used to create a user-friendly interface, and MySQL serves as the backend for storing student information.
    This project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
    integrated within a Java-based desktop application.
